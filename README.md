# FizzbuzzSpringBoot

Convert the simplified version of Fizzbuzz to a SpringBoot project! 

### FizzBuzz recap: 

- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
- If the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print "Fizzbuzz"
- Otherwise, print the number

### Features/Functionalities:

- User enters a start number and end number
- Store the output in a ArrayList<String>
- Loop through the list and print each value in the arraylist
- All logic from Fizzbuzz should be in another class (no logic code in the controller besides routing paths to HTML pages!)

### Fizzbuzz object should at least have:

- Start number (int)
- End number (int)

### Validations:

- Start number can NOT be negative
